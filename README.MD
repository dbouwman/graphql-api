## Ideas

- expose core portal entities via graphql

- convert thumbnail etc into fully-qualified urls


## Questions
- how to genericize parts of the graphs that are not searchable and/or vary greatly
  - is there a value in type-specific validations? webmap vs site etc?
- how should sharing work?
